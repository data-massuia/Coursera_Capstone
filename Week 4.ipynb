    "Clustering is considered to be one of the most popular unsupervised machine learning techniques used for grouping data points, or objects that are somehow similar. Cluster analysis has many applications in different domains, whether it be a bank's desire to segment his customers based on certain characteristics, or helping an individual to organize in-group his, or her favorite types of music. Generally speaking though, clustering is used mostly for discovering structure, summarization, and anomaly detection.\n",
